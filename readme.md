## Kanbuddy
A kanban board for minimalists and other assorted weirdos.

### Operation
Launch: ``python3 kanbuddy.py``
- Create a new card with CTRL-A
- Double click card to edit.
- Once a card has been completed, drop it in the bottom-right spot and watch your points go up!

### Settings
Within ``settings.json``, the following can be adjusted:
- Fonts
- Color Scheme
- Default window size
- Fullscreened/Windowed mode (add this!!!!)
- Margin/Header size

Sections can also be added or removed from the board. You can adjust the section title, width and card height within the section. The last section will always have the final card spot replaced with the point counter.
